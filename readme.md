SA:MP chatlog saver

Run it in the background. On first run, it will ask for the "Documents" directory of your SA:MP. This will only be asked once. From second run, you will only be asked to verify whether the given directory is correct. 

Chatlogs are saved every time you quit the game (after the GTA_Sa.exe process stops; thus crashes are included).

Basic python implementation and code is self explanatory.
